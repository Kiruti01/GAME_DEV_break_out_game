# GAME_DEV_break_out_game

This is a script for a Breakout game using the Python turtle module. 
The game consists of a paddle, a ball, a wall made up of bricks, and a scoreboard. 
The player uses the left and right arrow keys to move the paddle and the spacebar to pause or unpause the game. 
The goal is to use the paddle to keep the ball in play and bounce it off the wall to destroy all the bricks. 
The game has two levels, and the player must complete both levels to win. The script defines functions for moving the paddle, 
moving the ball, and detecting collisions with the paddle, the walls, and the bricks. 
It also defines functions for starting a new game, ending the game, and pausing and quitting the game. 
The script also includes code for displaying the score and handling user input through keyboard bindings.
